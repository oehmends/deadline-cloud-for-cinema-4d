"""Run the mock Deadline backend in a separate process.

Why a separate process (not a thread)
--------------------------------------
The xa11y accessibility library is a native extension (``_native.abi3.so``)
whose ``wait_visible`` / ``wait_hidden`` poll loops hold the CPython GIL for the
large majority of their duration (measured: ~13 background-thread ticks during a
6.4s wait, vs ~64 expected if the GIL were free). The submitter integ test calls
``wait_hidden(timeout=60s)`` while the queue environments load.

If the mock server runs as a daemon *thread* in the pytest process, that 60s
native wait starves the server thread: it can barely accept connections, so the
Cinema 4D subprocess's HTTP calls pile up past the listen backlog and time out,
the queue-env load never completes, the "Loading Queue Environments..." caption
never clears, and the wait rides its full 60s. (Tell-tale sign: the server logs
a served request the instant ``wait_hidden`` returns.)

Running the server in its own process gives it an independent GIL, so it keeps
serving at full speed no matter what xa11y does on the test side.

Observability across the process boundary
------------------------------------------
``call_counts`` / ``request_log`` / ``unmatched_requests`` live in the child
process now, so the test can't read the backend object directly. The server
exposes them at ``GET /__admin__/calls``; :class:`RemoteBackend` fetches that
endpoint on attribute access, so existing assertions
(``backend.call_counts``, ``backend.unmatched_requests``) keep working.
