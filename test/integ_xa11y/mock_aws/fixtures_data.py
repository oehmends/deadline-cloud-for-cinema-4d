"""Ground-truth response data for the mock Deadline backend.

These values were originally captured from a live Deadline Cloud farm, then
**sanitized**: real account ids, role ARNs, S3 bucket name, and operator
principal were replaced with obviously-fake placeholders. Only the response
*shapes* need to be faithful.

Call set for the Export-bundle flow: ``ListFarms``, ``GetFarm``, ``GetQueue``,
``ListQueueEnvironments``. The mock returns an empty queue-environment list (see
``deadline.py``), so the exported bundle carries no ``CondaPackages`` /
``CondaChannels``.
