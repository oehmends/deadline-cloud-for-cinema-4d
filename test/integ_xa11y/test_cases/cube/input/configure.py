"""Dialog configurator for the `cube` test case.

`test_cinema4d.py` loads the top-level ``configure(dialog)`` function below and
runs it against the submitter dialog after it loads and before Export bundle is
pressed. It exercises a spread of Shared and Job-specific settings via the
``submitter_ui`` page-object.

Every change here is **render-neutral** -- it alters job metadata, logging, and
the output *directory name*, but not the rendered pixels -- so the expected
renders are unchanged. The changes do alter the exported bundle, so
``expected/job_bundle/`` reflects the post-configure state (re-capture it if you
change anything here; see test/AGENTS.md).

    # the render-compare dir from OutputPath, so it follows this automatically.
